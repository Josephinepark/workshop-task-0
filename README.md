# Workshop 0 : start writing code
sketch using 2D Primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals.

[website link] https://josephinepark.github.io/workshop-task-0/

## Task
[] make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals <br>
[] experiment with at least one of the following primitive shapes from the https://p5js.org/reference/ (line, triangle, quad, arc.) <br>
[]  experiment with at least one new item from the https://p5js.org/reference/

- createCanvas : function name (command) / (400, 400) : arguments 
- by changing the number of the background the colours could be changed.
- layering = order

I have added the variables and conditinoals.
- variables (let = x ...)
- conditionals (IF ...)

#### Challenges and Solutions
**challenge** : I have tried to make two shapes in one background. However, I have faced a problem of upcoming with only one shape.<br>
**solution** : I have written the draw() function twice and in coding, when tow functions have the same name, the last defined function overwrites the previous one. So I have removed the repeating part of draw() and merged into one except the shape part.


## codes
- These are the 2D primitive shapes what I have used from the p5.js documentation.

## Future Development
Through this workshop, I learned what coding is and I was able to make simple 2D shapes. It was interesting that if I type it in a computer language, the result comes out. Computer language (coding) is not familiar to me, so it was not easy to learn one thing and have the shape put where I want to be. In the next workshop, I want to try and create something better, not just simple shapes. Through this exercise, I have used random functions, so I will try better results with this.

These tutorials were really helpful as a beginner to coding.
