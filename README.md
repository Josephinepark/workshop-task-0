- createCanvas : function name (command) / (400, 400) : arguments 
- by changing the number of the background the colours could be changed.
- layering = order

I have followed the YouTube tutorial and tried it in many ways.

### Challenges and Solutions
**challenge** : I have tried to make two shapes in one background. However, I have faced a problem of upcoming with only one shape.
**solution** : I have written the draw() function twice and in coding, when tow functions have the same name, the last defined function overwrites the previous one. So I have removed the repeating part of draw() and merged into one except the shape part.
